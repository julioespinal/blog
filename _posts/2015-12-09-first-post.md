title: "First Post: My Intentions"
---

I was coerced into starting this blog. To be honest, I'm grateful for the push.

A Short Bio
===========

So, I'm a C++ programmer, and I work almost exclusively using Visual Studio. I keep up to date on C++ and VS because, well, I like trying out new things. I also like to brainstorm ways of using the new language features in my projects (and not just for the sake of using them, though sometimes I cannot help it).

Goals for this Blog
===================

Back when I was working on my masters degree, I was told to imagine the set of all knowledge as a giant circle. Each person can contribute by adding their small dot of knowledge to the edge. Zooming in, one would see the edge is jagged and slowly expanding over time through new contributions.

My goal for this blog is pretty simple: If I feel that I have something to contribute to the already vast C++ knowledge base, I will add my dot!

It might not be all C++ talk, either. Mostly, yes. I may post about other things related to software development.
